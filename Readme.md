My [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) can suggest and vote for their favorite project ideas to help prioritize them.

## Suggestions

These can be anything, a package that you need for project, a desktop or web application you'd love to have, a framework that would help make something easier for your team, a blog article to learn more about a subject I'm familiar with, just let me know! The more sponsors I have, the more time I can dedicate to new and existing projects.

## Voting

Leave a :thumbsup: to vote. Resulting priorities will be filtered by sponsors, if you'd like to see work done on any of these projects, or my existing software, consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) me.
